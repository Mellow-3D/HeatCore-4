# Key Features of HeatCore 4 UHF Hotend
1. Ultra-Compact Design
4 mm High-Performance Heater Cartridge: Minimizes heater block volume for reduced thermal mass and faster response.

Lightweight Construction: Lowers overall printhead weight, improving printer dynamics and speed.

2. High-Power Heating System
60 W Heater: Achieves target temperatures in seconds, dramatically cutting preheat times.

400 °C Maximum: Supports high-temperature materials with a Pt1000 temperature sensor for precise control.

3. Aerospace-Grade Wear-Resistant Throat
Low-Friction Material: Reduces filament drag and heat loss, ensuring smooth, consistent flow.

4. Titanium-Reinforced Structure
Innovative Screw-Support Framework: Distributes mechanical stress across the hotend, enhancing reliability during long prints.

5. V6 Nozzle Compatibility
Standard Copper Nozzle Included: Easily swap in hardened steel, tungsten carbide, or silicon carbide nozzles to suit abrasive or high-temperature filaments.

6. Exceptional Flow Performance
   Up to 40 mm³/s Throughput: Guarantees stable feeding at high print speeds, maximizing productivity.

# Highlights of the ALPS Pressure-Based Leveling Module
Nozzle Calibration Probe

1. 24-Bit High-Precision ADC
ADS131M02 Chip: Sampling at 64 kHz to detect minute pressure changes, outperforming HX711-based sensors.

2. On-Chip Signal Amplification
128× Gain: Enhances sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio for reliable bed triggering.

3. Advanced Noise Reduction
Low-Drift Reference & Kalman Filtering: Slashes measurement error by over 90 %, delivering ultra-stable readings.

4. Plug-and-Play Threshold Adjustment
USB Interface: Allows real-time threshold tuning on a PC—no coding or firmware tweaks required.

5. Broad Firmware Compatibility
Modular Integration: Works seamlessly with Klipper, Marlin, RRF, and other popular firmwares for custom pressure-based leveling workflows.

We provide a 1.5 meter cable for the ALPS module to connect directly to the motherboard Uart interface.
